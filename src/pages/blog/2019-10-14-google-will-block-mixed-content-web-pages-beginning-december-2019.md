Currently Google loads pages with mixed content. Beginning in December 2019 with the introduction of Chrome 79, Google will do two things:



Google will automatically upgrade http content to https if that resource exists on https.

Google will introduce a toggle that a Chrome user can use to unblock insecure resources that Chrome is blocking.

Although this isnâ€™t a full blocking, it might as well be because users may opt to back out of a site that displays a security warning.



This will be a bad experience for publishers and may lead to less sales, visitors and ad views.



Beginning in January 2020 Google will remove the unblocking option and begin blocking mixed content web pages.
